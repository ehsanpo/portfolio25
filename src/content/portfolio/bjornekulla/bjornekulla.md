<h2>Björnekulla: Interactive 3D Product Visualization</h2>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>
  For Björnekulla, I developed a front-end solution to create an interactive 3D, rotatable product image. This solution allowed users to view products from all angles by rotating them directly on the website, enhancing user engagement and showcasing the product in a dynamic way.
</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>3D interactive product visualization built with jQuery and JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Seamless user interaction with smooth rotation functionality.</li>
  <li>Lightweight, front-end-only implementation without the need for additional plugins or frameworks.</li>
</ul>
