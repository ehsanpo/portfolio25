Zhowtime was a passion project that emerged from a deep admiration for Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a local hero. Ehsan, along with Art Director Luang Lu, embarked on this journey to create a website dedicated to showcasing every goal scored by Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The project aimed to celebrate and honor Zlatan's remarkable football career.

<h2>Project Goals</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> Goal Showcase: Develop a platform to display all of Zlatan Ibrahimovic's goals, providing a comprehensive collection for fans and enthusiasts.</li>
        <li> User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that allows easy navigation and exploration of the goals.</li>
        <li>Database Management: Establish an efficient database system to manage the extensive video collection, allowing seamless filtering and categorization.</li>
    </ul>

<br /><br />

<h2>Process and Implementation</h2>

    <h3>Data Collection and Organization:</h3>
        Gathered a comprehensive collection of over 400 goals scored by Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
        Utilized a Google Sheets document to initially catalog and organize the goal data.

     <h3>Website Development - Initial Version:</h3>
        Developed the initial version of the website using AngularJS, organizing and displaying the goals.
        Encountered performance issues with AngularJS due to the extensive goal list, leading to a decision to shift away from AngularJS.

     <h3>Database Implementation and Optimization:</h3>
        Set up a MySQL database to store goal information and video data.
        Integrated PHP for backend functionalities to manage XHR calls, filtering, and data retrieval, optimizing the site's performance.

     <h3>Admin Interface Development:</h3>
        Created an intuitive admin interface to allow easy addition and editing of goal entries, ensuring scalability and flexibility.

     <h3>Design and Merchandise:</h3>
        Collaborated with Luang Lu, leveraging his design skills to create custom t-shirts for sale on the website, adding a commercial aspect to the project.

<br /><br />

<h2>Results and Challenges</h2>

Unfortunately, despite the successful development and popularity of Zhowtime, the project faced legal challenges due to copyright violations. The site had to be taken down after receiving warnings from TV4 for the use of copyrighted video material, leading to the loss of the rights to some videos. This unfortunate turn of events highlighted the importance of copyright compliance and the need to obtain proper rights and licenses for video content.
Conclusion
<br /><br />
Zhowtime was a labor of love, celebrating the sporting achievements of a local hero. The project showcased the dedication of Ehsan and Luang Lu in creating a platform for fans to relish Zlatan Ibrahimovic's legendary goals. While the legal challenges posed a setback, the experience and lessons learned from this project are invaluable, emphasizing the significance of adhering to legal and copyright standards in web development and content presentation.
