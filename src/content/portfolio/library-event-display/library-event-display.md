This project aimed to provide a visually appealing and functional way to keep visitors informed about the library's activities.

  <li>Visually engaging front-end design tailored for TV screens.</li>
  <li>Responsive and easy-to-read layout optimized for various screen sizes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collaboration and Teamwork:</h3>
<p>
  This project was a collaborative effort involving a team of backend developers and myself. I worked on-site to ensure seamless communication and coordination with the team, which was crucial for the successful implementation of the project. My primary responsibilities included designing the front-end interface and handling API calls to fetch event data from the Drupal backend.
