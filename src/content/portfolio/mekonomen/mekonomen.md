 <h2>Mekonomen Car Repair Website: A Case Study in Agile Development and Multi-site Implementation</h2>

  <h3>Introduction:</h3>
  <p>
    Mekonomen, a leading car repair and service provider, approached our team with the task of developing a comprehensive website to showcase their car repair shops in multiple countries. In collaboration with a front-end/UX developer and a backend developer, I played a crucial role as the project lead. Our goal was to create a user-friendly and informative website that would feature a searchable Google Maps integration, individual landing pages for each shop, and a time booking system with an API for calculating car service costs. The project was implemented as a multi-site WordPress solution to cater to Mekonomen's presence in Finland, Iceland, and Estonia, while allowing for the addition of multiple languages.
  </p>

  <h3>Graphic Profile and Style Guide:</h3>
  <p>
    To ensure brand consistency, Mekonomen provided us with a detailed graphic profile and style guide in Sketch format. These assets served as the foundation for our design and development process, enabling us to create a website that aligns with Mekonomen's visual identity.
  </p>

  <h3>Agile Development Process:</h3>
  <p>
    Working in an agile team, we embraced an iterative development process that allowed for flexibility and collaboration. As the project lead, I coordinated the efforts between the front-end/UX developer, backend developer, and myself to ensure seamless communication and efficient progress throughout the project lifecycle.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Features:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Searchable Google Maps Integration: The website incorporated a powerful Google Maps integration that enabled users to easily search for Mekonomen car repair shops in their preferred location. This feature enhanced the user experience and facilitated convenient access to nearby shops.</li>
    <li>Individual Landing Pages: Each Mekonomen shop had its dedicated landing page, offering important information such as shop details, opening hours, frequently asked questions, and a comprehensive list of available services. This allowed customers to make informed decisions before visiting a shop.</li>
    <li>Time Booking System: We implemented a user-friendly time booking system that allowed customers to schedule appointments for car servicing. By leveraging an API, the system accurately calculated the cost of servicing based on the customer's car model and mileage. This feature ensured a streamlined booking process and enabled the workshop to prepare the necessary spare parts and materials.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Multi-site Implementation:</h3>
  <p>
    As part of the project, we developed a multi-site WordPress solution to accommodate Mekonomen's presence in Finland, Iceland, and Estonia. The website was primarily built in English, while also providing the flexibility to add additional languages in the future. This scalable approach allowed Mekonomen to effectively cater to their diverse customer base across different countries and regions.
  </p>

  <h3>Maintenance and Server Management:</h3>
  <p>
    Following the website's successful launch, I took on the responsibility of site maintenance, including bug fixes and ensuring the smooth operation of Mekonomen's servers (Stage & Prod) running on RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux). Regular maintenance ensured an optimal user experience and uninterrupted access to Mekonomen's services.
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
  <p>
    The Mekonomen Car Repair Website project exemplified our team's expertise in agile development and multi-site implementation. By delivering a user-friendly website featuring a searchable Google Maps integration, individual landing pages for each shop, and a convenient time booking system, we provided Mekonomen with an effective online platform. The multi-site WordPress solution enabled seamless expansion across different countries, and the ability to add languages ensured future scalability. Ongoing maintenance and server management ensured a reliable user experience for Mekonomen's customers, solidifying the success of the project.
