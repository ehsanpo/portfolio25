<h2>Soctanter på nätet: A Case Study in Developing a User-Friendly Platform for Social Guidance</h2>

  <h3>Introduction:</h3>
  <p>
    Soctanter på nätet is an online social counseling service provided by Malmö City. The platform offers guidance and support on various social issues, including addiction, finances, and other social concerns. Users have the opportunity to ask anonymous questions related to these topics, and they can also browse through existing questions and answers. The project's mission was to migrate the old Soctanter website to a new platform based on Drupal forum. However, during the pre-studies, we realized the challenges faced by moderators in using a forum-based platform. As a result, we had meetings with the responsible individuals at Soctanter and were assigned the task of developing a new user-friendly platform that would allow users to submit questions and moderators to provide answers. The backend was designed to provide Soctanter with all the necessary features for effective management.
  </p>

  <h3>Platform Development:</h3>
  <p>
    Understanding the unique needs of Soctanter and the importance of user-friendliness, we decided to deviate from the initial plan of using a Drupal forum. Instead, we developed a custom theme Drupal that catered specifically to the requirements of both users and moderators. The platform was designed to streamline the process of submitting questions and receiving answers, ensuring a more efficient and intuitive user experience. Additionally, the backend was carefully crafted to provide moderators with the necessary tools and features to effectively manage and respond to user inquiries.
  </p>

  <h3>User-Submitted Questions and Moderator Interaction:</h3>
  <p>
    The new platform allowed users to submit anonymous questions related to a range of social issues. These questions were then routed to the moderators, who were responsible for providing accurate and helpful answers. Through a user-friendly interface, moderators could easily review and respond to the questions, ensuring timely and meaningful guidance. The platform created a secure and confidential space for users to seek assistance and receive the support they needed.
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
  <p>
    The development of the Soctanter på nätet platform showcased our commitment to creating a user-friendly and efficient system for social guidance. By recognizing the challenges faced by moderators in using a traditional forum-based platform, we tailored the development process to meet the specific needs of Soctanter and the users they serve. The resulting platform enabled users to submit anonymous questions and receive guidance from knowledgeable moderators. The project's success was a testament to our ability to adapt and deliver a solution that prioritized user-friendliness and effective communication between users and moderators.
