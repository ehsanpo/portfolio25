<h2>PX To Tailwind</h2>

Convert Pixels to REM & Tailwind Classes

Quickly convert pixel values into REM units and Tailwind CSS classes in your vs code. It adapts pixel-based designs to scalable REM units (defaulting to a 16px base font-size) and provides the corresponding Tailwind classes.

The tool also rounds values to the nearest pixel and Tailwind class, making it easy to integrate custom sizes into your Tailwind config file. Streamline your responsive design workflow with precise conversions and seamless integration.
