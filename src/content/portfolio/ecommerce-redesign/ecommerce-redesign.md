# E-Commerce Platform Redesign

A comprehensive redesign and redevelopment of a legacy e-commerce platform, focusing on modern user experience, performance, and accessibility.

## Project Overview

The client needed to modernize their outdated e-commerce platform that was struggling with poor user experience, slow performance, and maintenance issues. The goal was to create a modern, scalable solution that would improve conversion rates and customer satisfaction.

## Key Features

- Advanced product filtering and search
- Real-time inventory management
- Integrated payment processing
- Multi-language support
- Progressive Web App capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and optimization
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom design tokens
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express.js
- **PostgreSQL** database with Prisma ORM
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **Stripe** integration for payments

## Results

- **40% increase** in conversion rate
- **60% faster** page load times

- **50% reduction** in cart abandonment

## Challenges & Solutions
